    Things to do: 
    Need to implememnt a way of removing things. Removing renderpasses, render commands, pipeline objects. etc.
    Need to add Pipeline Layouts to the things that create_graphics_pipeline will complete on.
    Should provide an option to create a graphics pipeline that sets the render region for you.
    Need to think about how to bring back the xforms to the painter. Perhaps if I don't provide
    a render command for a mode, like brush resizing, I don't have access to that mode.
    I need to separate out the rendering from the presentation, I think. Or, the rendering from the strokes.
    Perhaps the paint does not actually render things, but instead create strokes and stroke points, 
    which then get renderered on a steady interval?
    Look into adding atomics for stopping the window and command line threads with a single action.
    Need a way to filter reports by type when printing them out.
