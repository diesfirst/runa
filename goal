I have an idea for how this software could end up looking at the end of everything.
The idea is for a kind of latex of cg. Or a language for writing a cg software. 
Kind of like houdini to the next level. We are no longer creating a recipe for an
asset, we are creating a recipe for a software. So I create some lines or text 
in a particular format, and that is markup for what the scene will create. So could have some
thing like:
[sphere]
    radius 1
[sphere]
    radius 2
    color 1, 0, 0
That looks a lot like USD, and it seems that USD already solves that problem.
But that is static. What about a script that sets up the rendering environment,
loads shaders, adds states to that did not exist before. Needs more thought
